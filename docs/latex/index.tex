Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA is platform which supports high fidelity emulation of I\+EC 61131-\/3 compliant P\+L\+Cs and S\+C\+A\+DA protocols. It can be used to build and simulate complex environments involving cyber-\/physical systems. Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA P\+L\+Cs can be run inside network emulators like C\+O\+R\+E/\+Mininet and interact with other emulated processes. Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA also provides python interfaces to link the network emulation with a physical system simulator. Using these interfaces Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA P\+L\+Cs can interact with physical system simulators like Matpower, Simulink, Man\+Py etc. Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA also ships with support for virtual time based control which is handled by \href{http://www.github.com/Vignesh2208/Kronos}{\tt Kronos}. This allows tight time-\/synchronization between the physical system simulation and Open\+S\+C\+A\+DA network emulation.
